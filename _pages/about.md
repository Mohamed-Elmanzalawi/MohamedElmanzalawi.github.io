Hi! I am a master's student at the <a href="https://www.nig.ac.jp/nig/" target="_blank" style="color:#3B528B;">National Institute of Genetics</a>, Mishima, Japan working on bioinformatics tool development and human diseases where I try to link potential pathogenic variants to rare disease. <br> 

Throughout my research journey, I have cultivated a diverse skill set in bioinformatics, with a particular focus on genomic analysis. I have specialized in building pipelines for various projects, including **variant analysis and annotation for rare diseases**. My data analysis expertise includes  advanced **data manipulation, statistical analysis, machine learning, and visualization techniques**, which enable me to extract and interpret complex biological insights from large-scale datasets. Additionally, I have successfully developed my first tool **[DFAST_QC: quality assessment and taxonomic identification tool for prokaryotic Genomes](https://github.com/nigyta/dfast_qc)**.

Feel free to contact me for any inquiries or potential collaborations in any research topic. You can reach me at <a href="mailto:mohamed.elmanzalawi@nig.ac.jp" target="_blank" style="color:#3B528B;">mohamed.elmanzalawi@nig.ac.jp</a>.<br>

*Key words:*<br>
Bioinformatics; pipeline development; machine learning; human genetics; rare diseases; microbial taxonomy; variant analysis<br>
